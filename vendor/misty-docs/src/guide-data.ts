      "Misty is a file manager that brings your local and cloud storage into one native app. Instead of jumping between browser tabs and separate tools, you can browse, move, and manage everything in one place.",
      "At its core, Misty uses a local proxy that connects directly to multiple cloud providers. That proxy runs on your machine, and your data never passes through a Misty server.",
      "Alongside file management, Misty includes a plugin system for custom workflows, encrypted Vault backups powered by restic, a Gemini-powered AI assistant that understands your files, and Tailscale support for secure remote access.",

      "That makes Misty useful even before you move many files around. For a lot of people, the first big win is simply finding the right file without remembering which provider it lives in.",

      "Plugins let you extend Misty beyond basic file browsing. The idea is to make custom workflows feel native to the app instead of forcing everything through one fixed interface.",
      "That can mean automation, internal tools, custom panels, or workflows that tie together cloud storage, local files, and your own systems.",
      "The plugin system is meant to keep Misty flexible. You can start simple, then gradually shape the app around the way you actually work.",

      "The best way to build for Misty is to begin with a narrow use case that already matters to you, then grow from there as the workflow proves itself.",
      "That keeps plugins useful, understandable, and easier to maintain over time.",

      "The value is not just chat for the sake of chat. It is about understanding your working directory, your connected storage, and the context around the files you already manage in Misty.",

      "That can mean opening, organizing, or preparing files for the next step in your workflow.",
